===============================================================================

For this project, I started working with basic JavaScript and learning the
language's syntax. I learned how to write and define objects, variables,
strings, booleans and arrays, as well as use the comparison operators, if/else
statements, functions and methods.

This project was completed while I was a student in The Iron Yard's Front End
Engineeering course.
